You step inside the greenhouse. The air smells of soil and sunlight.
Farming isn’t too hard once you get the rhythm.
Start by tilling the soil — just click on a patch of dirt to loosen it up.
You’ll need seeds next. Open your inventory and equip them.
Click the tilled soil again to plant.
Don’t forget to water it — there’s a watering can near the entrance.
Every new day, your plant will grow a little more... but only if it’s watered.
Keep at it daily until it’s fully grown.
